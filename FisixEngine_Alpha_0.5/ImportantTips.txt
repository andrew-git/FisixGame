Please keep the following in mind when developing with the engine:

- The Fisix Engine is currently in alpha version, and is still buggy/unstable...
  please report all bugs so that they can be fixed quickly

- Due to no apparant reason, swf files work about 10 fps slower in an internet browser if the 'wmode' parameter isn't set to 'transparent' or 'opaque'
  If you find that your fisix application isn't running quickly enough, try sure to change the wmode parameter in your html file
  (A word of caution, wmode-transparent is known to cause some random problems in firefox)

  *** when compiling the given examples files in flex, wmode will not be 'opqaue' by default, which causes the simulation to run
      slower than it's supposed to ***

- For some reason, AS 3.0 timers are a bit choppy, so instead of using FisixEngine.startEngine() (which uses a timer)
  use FisixEngine.mainLoop(dt) within an ENTER_FRAME event listener.

- Have Fun with it!
